### Query Reference and QuerySnapshot
``` 
- A query is a request we make to firestore to give us something from the database.

- Firestore returns us two types of objects: 
    reference and snapshots. Of these objects, 
    they can be either Document or Collection versions.

Firestore will always return us thes objects, even if nothing exist at 
from the query.
