### Query Reference and QuerySnapshot
``` 
- A query is a request we make to firestore to give us something from the database.

- Firestore returns us two types of objects: 
    reference and snapshots. Of these objects, 
    they can be either Document or Collection versions.

Firestore will always return us thes objects, even if nothing exist at 
from the query.

```

### Redux

```
Redux is good at managing state specially large state as the app go bigger and bigger.

It is useful to share data between containers. Redux predictable state management
- Single source of truth
- State is read only (immutability)
- Changes using pure function.
